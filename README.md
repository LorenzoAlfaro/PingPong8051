# Ping Pong 8051

### Introduction.

Welcome! For some crazy reason you are reading about a project based on Intel's Microcontroller 8051, relesead in the year of our Lord 1980. I guess some people just like old techy stuff, eh?

The purpose of this repository is to preserve the work I created during a college course taken in 2012. I was supposed to build a minimum system that did something useful.

Being the gamer that I am decided I to build a ping pong game... in assembly language... ouch!


### The Hardware side of things.

The project was built a round an LED matrix which was custom made. (My partner built it so he got to keep it). Lots of soldering LEDs. You can see these very low res video I took and a picture I took of it.

### Current state

Having enjoyed working on this project, I feel it a shame not to document it and even enhance it. While working on cleaning up the code I realized something. I got it to work then. But did a terribly job in writting maintainable code.

Even though I don't have the original hardware. I found a way to simulate it. The downside is that the simulated matrix is only 8x8. So the project has lost its glorious 15x15 resolution.

Simulated version 8x8
